The Contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible for the Solution, in support of the CFPB Source Code Policy. Regardless of license(s) used (MIT, GNU, Creative Commons) the license(s) shall be listed in the contract and clearly set forth in a conspicuous place when delivered to the CFPB. Wherever possible, the license should be attached to or included within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a software repository. Per section II.3.b, these requirements do not abrogate the unlimited rights of the CFPB in the work produced by the Contractor (see above section). This includes the right to move the work into the public domain.
 
If the Contractor needs to use a restrictive license, the Contractor is required to request permission from the CFPB, in writing, before incorporating copyrighted work either into the Solution, the operations or maintenance of the Solution, or training materials that support the Solution. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a conspicuous place when delivered to the CFPB and wherever possible the license should be attached to or included within the work itself.
